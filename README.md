[Link to FCC project page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/image-search-abstraction-layer)

### Objective
Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images like this: https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10 and browse recent search queries like this: https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/. Then deploy it to Glitch.

1. **User Story**: I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
2. **User Story**: I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
3. **User Story**: I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
